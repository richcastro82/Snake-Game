# Snake Game
This is the classic snake game we all know and love. I grabbed the graphics for the snake and apple from stock images on Adobe Stock and used the PyGame library to help speed the build along. I plan to add a few custom features to the game in the future: poison apples and random obstacles. I will also create a intro/start screen at some point as well. 


I used free sound resources from FreeSound.org  \

This game is part of my programming portfolio. It's an example of python programming and has a few programming concepts. Object Oriented Programming, Vector arrays, game logic and graphics. I have a list of upgrades planned for this game in the near future. Poison apples, obsticles, a pause screen, high score board, and a few others.
