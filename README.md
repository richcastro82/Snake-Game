# Snake Game
This is the classic snake game we all know and love. I grabbed the graphics for the snake and apple from stock images on Adobe Stock and used the PyGame library to help speed the build along. I plan to add a few custom features to the game in the future: poison apples and random obstacles. I will also create a intro/start screen at some point as well. 


# To use the code: 
1. Download the repo
2. install the pygame library 
3. Open command prompt and navigate to the folder
4. run: 'python snake.py'
5. Enjoy
